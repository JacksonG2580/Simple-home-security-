Arduino with buzzer, led , and pir motion sensor that detects and buzzes when movement is detected 

Arduino Board | Uno or Mega | Main function is to detected motion when near sensor when motion is detected buzzer will buzz for a second and the led with turn on with it, You need jumper wire, led, 220 ohm resisor, 100 ohm resistor, PIR motion sensor, Active buzzer, female to male wires, Arduino in my case Arduino Mega 2560.

Potential issues - Pir motion sensor consistently sensing motion
